The vendored file is byte-identical to the upstream blob (git object
`1c4f4ffe1015fbb4541433cf291234ca32338871`).

## DeepFilterNet 3 — WebAssembly build

- File: `src/renderer/public/deepfilternet3/pkg/df_bg.wasm`
- Size: 9 068 001 bytes
- SHA-256: `0027c731a1093589b78f73a997a6b10c387862f451542041b5b673eea10e4812`
- Contains: a `wasm32-unknown-unknown` build of the DeepFilterNet Rust implementation
  (MIT or Apache-2.0, copyright (c) 2021 Hendrik Schröter) behind a `wasm-bindgen` wrapper
- Built by: `.github/workflows/build-deepfilter-wasm.yml`, run 32790281941, from
  <https://github.com/Rikorose/DeepFilterNet> at commit
  `d375b2d8309e0935d165700c91da9de862a99c31` — crate `deep_filter` 0.5.7-pre with
  `--no-default-features --features wasm`, rustc 1.97.1, wasm-bindgen 0.2.92, `wasm-opt -O3`

The DeepFilterNet project does not publish a WebAssembly artifact, so this one is compiled from
its sources. It is pinned by size and SHA-256 in `scripts/fetch-deepfilter-assets.cjs`, which
refuses to build if the bytes change.
